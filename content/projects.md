## We believe in: 

- Asking the right questions. Clear communication.
- Trial and error.
- Measuring. What doesn't get measured doesn't get improved.

## Sales
At Junto, everyone does Sales. The process looks like this:

1. Someone contacts us.
2. They fill out our Questionnaire (You can find it on our Junto Studio project on Basecamp)
3. We Hangout/Skype with them if necessary.
4. We discuss the project with the team. We figure out: 
	+ If we want to take it
	+ if we'll learn enough from doing it
	+ how much time it will take
	+ how much it'll cost
	+ who'll be involved
5. Send out a quote. (You can find the template on our Junto Studio project on Basecamp)
6. The client makes the downpayment.
7. We begin work.

This is what we look for in our clients and the projects we take:
- We can learn a lot from them.
- They understand and value highly the work we do and how we do it.
- We believe we can add a lot of value to their business.
- They can #KeepTheirWord and have high integrity.

We track our leads using the *Sales Funnel Board* in our Trello. The person responsible for the lead is also responsible for updating his/her card on Trello.

## How to manage a new project

Once the downpayment has been made, these are the steps to start a new project:

1. Create a new project on Basecamp.
1. Assign a project lead by writing his/her name on the description field in Basecamp.
1. Fill Out the Project Template when beginning a project.
1. Create a project channel on Slack.
1. Keep [Our Promises]()
1. A project is considered done when you’ve delivered Docked the Boat. (see “Docking the Boat”)

A project lead's main responsibility is to bring up the conversations necessary to move the project forward. He/She shouldn't demand things from other people involved in the project.

## Development

_pending_

In this section we'll talk about some development guidelines. I'll outline them here so I don't forget to include them later

* All external links should have `target: :_blank`
* Indent correctly. Follow the file's style. If the author indented with two spaces, so should you.
* In Ruby files, tabs = 2 spaces. In HTML ones you can choose the one you like best
* When creating a string column, always set the default string to "".
* Avoid inline comments. Put them in a separate line above the code.
