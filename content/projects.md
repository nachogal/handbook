## Sales
At Junto, everyone does Sales. The process looks like this:
- Someone contacts us.
- They fill out our Questionnaire (You can find it on our Junto Studio project on Basecamp)
- We Hangout/Skype with them if necessary.
- We discuss the project with the team. We figure out: If we want to take it, if we'll learn from doing it, how much time it'd take, how much it'll cost, who'll be involved.
- Send out a quote. (You can find the template on our Junto Studi project on Basecamp)
- The client does the downpayment.
- We begin work.

This is what we look for in our clients and the projects we take:
- We can learn a lot from them.
- They understand and value highly the work we do and how we do it.
- We belive we can add a lot of value to their business.

We track our leads using the *Sales Funnel Board* in our Trello. The person responsible for the lead, is also responsible for updating his card on Trello.

##How to manage a new project:

1. Create a new project on Basecamp.
2. Assign a project lead by writing his name on the description field in Basecamp.
3. Fill Out the Project Template when beginning a project.
4. Keep [Our Promises]()
5. A project is considered done when you’ve delivered Docked the Boat. (see “Docking the Boat”)

A project lead main responsibility is to bring up the conversations necessary to move the project forward. He shouldn't demand things from other people involved in the project.
