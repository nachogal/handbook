# Project Management: Sales, Management, Programming, Design

## Sales
At Junto, everyone does Sales. The process looks like this:
- Someone contacts us.
- They fill out our Questionnaire (You can find it on our Junto Studio project on Basecamp)
- We Hangout/Skype with them if necessary.
- We discuss the project with the team. We figure out: If we want to take it, if we'll learn from doing it, how much time it'd take, how much it'll cost, who'll be involved.
- Send out a quote. (You can find the template on our Junto Studi project on Basecamp)
- The client does the downpayment.
- We begin work.

This is what we look for in our clients and the projects we take:
- We can learn a lot from them.
- They understand and value highly the work we do and how we do it.
- We belive we can add a lot of value to their business.

We track our leads using the *Sales Funnel Board* in our Trello. The person responsible for the lead, is also responsible for updating his card on Trello.

## Management

All projects will have a project on Basecamp and a lead, a person who is responsible for the project. We write this person's name on the Description field in a Basecamp card.

This does not mean that person is everyone's boss for that project. It means that person is responsible for bringing up the necessary conversations for the project to move forward.
