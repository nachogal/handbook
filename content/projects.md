## We believe in:

- Asking the right questions. Clear communication.
- Trial and error.
- Measuring. What doesn't get measured doesn't get improved.

## Sales
At Junto, everyone is involved in Sales. The process looks like this:

#### First Contact
1. Someone contacts us.
1. A card gets created and assigned to a team member (usually the Sales Guru)
on Trello.
1. The assigned team member sends our Questionnaire (You can find it on our
  Junto Studio project on Basecamp) for the client to answer.
1. The client fills out the Questionnaire.
1. We do a quick Hangout/Skype call (10min usually) to understand what the
project is about.

#### Discovery
1. We figure out who'll be involved.
1. The team for the project goes over the client's answers and the first Skype
call's notes and brainstorms a solution.
1. The involved team Hangouts/Skypes with the client to propose the solution.
  + Good discovery takes usually takes 2 or 3 interactions. If our solution is
  not what the client is looking for, we go back to the drawing board. If it is,
  we move on to the	next step.

#### Closing
1. We discuss the project with the team. We figure out:
  + If we want to take it
  + if we'll learn enough from doing it
  + how much time it will take
  + how much it'll cost
1. We Schedule a final Skype call to present the proposal. We go over each line
in the proposal with the client to make sure we're both on the same terms.
(You can find the template for the proposal on our Junto Studio project on Basecamp)
1. The client makes the downpayment (usually 50%).
1. We begin work.

This is what we look for in our clients and the projects we take:
- We can learn a lot from them.
- They understand and value highly the work we do and how we do it.
- We believe we can add a lot of value to their business.
- They can #KeepTheirWord and have high integrity.

We track our leads using the *Sales Funnel Board* in our Trello.

1. A new lead comes in, either through the website, email or through personal relationships.
1. Whoever adds the card to Trello assigns it to Sales Guru in turn (currently Majo until the end of March), which in turn assigns it to a volunteer, if there is one. This is done by "putting the person's face" on it.
1. This person is responsible for leading the client from the first interaction until we Skype/Hangout with them.

## How to manage a new project

Once the downpayment has been made, these are the steps to start a new project:

1. Create a new project on Basecamp.
1. Assign a project lead by writing his/her name on the description field in Basecamp.
1. Fill Out the Project Template when beginning a project.
1. Create a project channel on Slack.
1. Keep [Our Promises]()
1. A project is considered done when you’ve delivered Docked the Boat. (see “Docking the Boat”)

A project lead's main responsibility is to bring up the conversations necessary to move the project forward. He/She shouldn't demand things from other people involved in the project.
