## Sales
At Junto, everyone does Sales. The process looks like this:

1. Someone contacts us.
2. They fill out our Questionnaire (You can find it on our Junto Studio project on Basecamp)
3. We Hangout/Skype with them if necessary.
4. We discuss the project with the team. We figure out: If we want to take it, if we'll learn enough from doing it, how much time it will take, how much it'll cost, who'll be involved.
5. Send out a quote. (You can find the template on our Junto Studio project on Basecamp)
6. The client makes the downpayment.
7. We begin work.

This is what we look for in our clients and the projects we take:
- We can learn a lot from them.
- They understand and value highly the work we do and how we do it.
- We believe we can add a lot of value to their business.
- They can #KeepTheirWord and have high integrity.

We track our leads using the *Sales Funnel Board* in our Trello. The person responsible for the lead, is also responsible for updating his/her card on Trello.

##How to manage a new project:

1. Create a new project on Basecamp.
2. Assign a project lead by writing his/her name on the description field in Basecamp.
3. Fill Out the Project Template when beginning a project.
4. Keep [Our Promises]()
5. A project is considered done when you’ve delivered Docked the Boat. (see “Docking the Boat”)

A project lead's main responsibility is to bring up the conversations necessary to move the project forward. He shouldn't demand things from other people involved in the project.
