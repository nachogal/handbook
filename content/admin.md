# Administration

## Payments
Payments are done the last friday of the month. If a payday falls on a nonworking day, we'll use the preceding day.

## Expenses
Expenses under $50usd don't need prior approval. Reimbursements will be made only upon receipt (digital or physical).

## Vacation / Time-Off
We don't have a vacation policy. You are free to take as much time-off as you want whenever you want. We only ask that you let the people you're working with know that you're leaving two weeks in advance, and that if you have any critical tasks, you delegate them to someone else. If these conditions are not met, time-off will not be remunerated.
