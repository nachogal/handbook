# Guiding Principles

We started Junto Studio for two reasons:

1. **To create the future of learning.** To change traditional education. To use technology to help learners pursue self-improvement at their own pace, on their own time. In a collaborative, free, and encouraging environment.
2. **To create an environment where WE could learn.** Learn about technology, entrepreneurship, design, and how to live a life of meaning. Learn with people who challenge us, who encourage us, and who are willing to go to the end of the universe with us.

### We care deeply about:
- Integrity â€“ #KeepingOurWord
- Quality
- Having a Culture of Learning

### We believe people can be self-governed.

This means you'll have a lot of freedom to choose what to work on, when to work on it, and where to work from. 

This works well because:
- We have two clear reasons for why we exist (see above), and everyone at Junto is on board with them.
- Everyone on the team is smart, driven, and talented.
