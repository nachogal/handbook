## How we set priorities:
On Mondays during our [overlap](#overlaps) we talk about what are the most important things we should get done (as a company) for the week.

Everyone then chooses a work priority and a personal priority.
- **Work Priority**: How you are going to contribute to accomplishing the companies goals, for the current week.
- **Personal Priority**: Something personal that you want to work on this week. Examples: Practice a habit, learn something new, get something done.

## Accountability
Because we sometimes work remotely ([read more](/content/remote.md) on working remotely), it's important to document as much as we can.

After Monday's overlap, everyone will be aware of everyone's priorities for the week. 

After this, we keep our to-do's on Basecamp, which at the end of the day sends an email with a summary of what everyone accomplished for that day. This is why it's very important to keep our to-dos on Basecamp updated.

We also have an #accountability channel where we, at the start of our day, check-in by saying what we will be working on during the day. When we're finsihed working for the day, we post a status saying how it went.

This helps everyone be in the loop of what you're working on. That way, they can either help you or ask for help easily!

## From Idea to Action

This is the process an idea usually goes through:

1. Post the idea on the 'Everything' board in Trello, under the 'Ideas for (name of project)' list.
2. Once the time is right, Move that idea to the 'Ideas We Decided to Implement' list on the same Trello board.
3. When we decide who will be responsible for bringing the idea to life and when it should be done, we will move the idea to our Basecamp list on Trello and add it to the corresponding project on Basecamp.
4. The idea goes live.

## Overlaps

Overlaps are a big part of what makes Junto work, because this is the time when a lot of decisions are made, and bottlenecks are sorted out. Everyone on the team chats on Slack for about 30 minutes (at 12.30pm CST). Each day of the week has a theme.

- Monday: Setting priorities. 
- Tuesday: Processes and Product Development.
- Wednesday: Growth.
- Thursday: Feedback.
- Friday: The Company and its Culture.
