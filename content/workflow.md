## How we set priorities:
On Mondays during our [overlap](#overlaps) we talk about what are the most important things we should get done (as a company) for the week.

Everyone then chooses a work priority and a personal priority.
- **Work Priority**: How you are going to contribute to accomplishing the companies goals, for the current week.
- **Personal Priority**: Something personal that you want to work on this week. Examples: Practice a habit, learn something new, get something done.

## Accountability
Because we sometimes work remotely ([read more](/content/remote.md) on working remotely), it's important to document as much as we can.

After Monday's overlap, everyone will be aware of everyone's priorities for the week. 

There are two ways we keep each other accountable:
1. We keep our to-do's on Basecamp, this way everyone knows who's in charge of what and when it's due. At the end of the day Basecamp automatically sends an email with a summary of what everyone accomplished for that day. 
2. We also have an #accountability channel on Slack where we check-in at the the start of our workday by saying what we will be working on that day. This is to help keep everybody in the loop of what you're working on and it allows us to coordinate efforts better. (Working remotely we've found that using this channel has become invaluable.) At the end of your workday or periodically you can post a status on what you've accomplished and how the day went.

## From Idea to Action

This is the process an idea usually goes through:

1. Post the idea on the 'Everything' board in Trello, under the 'Ideas for (name of project)' list.
2. Once the time is right, Move that idea to the 'Ideas We Decided to Implement' list on the same Trello board.
3. When we decide who will be responsible for bringing the idea to life and when it should be done, we will move the idea to our Basecamp list on Trello and add it to the corresponding project on Basecamp.
4. The idea goes live.

## Overlaps

Overlaps are a big part of what makes Junto work, because this is the time when a lot of decisions are made, and bottlenecks are sorted out. Everyone on the team chats on Slack for about 30 minutes (at 12.30pm CST). Each day of the week has a theme.

- Monday: Setting priorities. 
- Tuesday: Processes and Product Development.
- Wednesday: Growth.
- Thursday: Feedback.
- Friday: The Company and its Culture.
