# Workflow

At Junto we believe that everyone is capable of managing their own time, setting their own priorities and keeping their word. We like being able to work from anywhere in the world and still be able to deliver great work. (Living the dream!)  So how do we create the Junto culture and stay informed with everybody everywhere?

- [Overlaps](#overlaps)
- [Preferred Platforms](#our-tools)

## How we set priorities:
We set our priorities for the week every Monday during our [overlap](#overlaps). The idea is to discuss "what are the most important things we should get done (as a company) for this week?"

Towards the end of the overlap everyone chooses a work priority and a personal priority.
- **Work Priority**: How you are going to contribute to accomplishing the companies goals, for the current week.
- **Personal Priority**: Something personal that you want to work on this week. Examples: Practice a habit, learn something new, get something done. Past examples have included: finishing coding guidelines, going through a code academy course, reading Alan Turing's biography, visiting grandma. 

After Monday's overlap, everyone will be aware of everyone else's priorities for the week. 

## Accountability
We [work remotely](/content/remote.md) part of the time, which means it's really important to keep our work as transparent as possible so we can coordinate our efforts.

There are two ways we keep each other accountable:

1. We keep our to-do's on a project management tool called [Basecamp](www.basecamp.com). With Basecamp, everyone knows who's in charge of what and when it's due. At the end of the day Basecamp automatically sends an email with a summary of what everyone accomplished for that day. 
2. We also have an #accountability channel on Slack where we:
    - Check-in at the the start of our workday by saying what we will be working on that day. This is to help keep everybody in the loop of what you're working on and it allows us to coordinate efforts better. (We've found that using this channel has become invaluable.) 
    - Check-out at the end of your workday (or periodically) by posting what you've accomplished and how the day went. We encourage posting work samples (e.g. documents, designs, commits) over just words.

## Over-communicate

We over-communicate with clients to avoid having scheduled meetings. Every problem arises from poor communication.

We over-communicate with our team to facilitate collaboration and coordination. Good decisions are made when there's clear information.

We:

- Are online on Slack while we're working.
- Respond to emails within 24 hours.
- Keep our to-do's in Basecamp up-to-date.
- Keep track of our ideas in Trello.
- Use Google Calendar invites for all our meetings, hangouts, etc.

## From Idea to Action

This is the process an idea usually goes through:

1. Post the idea on the 'Everything' board in Trello, under the '(name of project) Ideas' list.
2. Discuss the idea with the team over Slack. 
3. If we chose to implement the idea, move it to the 'Ideas We Decided to Implement' list on the same Trello board.
4. When we decide who will be responsible for bringing the idea to life and when it should be done, move the idea to our Basecamp list on Trello and add it to the corresponding project on Basecamp. Don't forget to assign the to-do to the right person!
5. The Basecamp to-do gets completed and the idea goes live.

## Overlaps

Overlaps are a big part of what makes Junto work, because this is the time when a lot of decisions are made, and bottlenecks are sorted out. Everyone on the team chats on Slack for about 30 minutes (at 12.30pm CST) and each day of the week has a theme.

- Monday: Setting priorities.
    + Reach clear company wide and individual priorities.
    + Note: Before the Monday overlap, please visit the Everything Trello board to ensure we don't miss any important to-do's
- Tuesday: Workflow and Product Development.
    + Discuss our workflow and our processes. What can we improve? What would make us more productive? Happier?
    + Resolve possible bottlenecks
- Wednesday: Growth.
    + Check-in with our metrics. Discuss plans for growth.
- Thursday: Feedback.
    + How did we feel throughout the week?
    + What went well? What could be improved upon?
    + Is there anything you would like to get off your chest?
- Friday: The Company and its Culture.
    + Learn together. Learn about each other. Have a dialogue.
