# Workflow

## How we set priorities:
On Mondays we have a discussion about what are the most important things we should get done (as a company) for the week.

Everyone then chooses a work priority and a personal priority.
- **Work Priority**: How you are going to contribute to accomplishing the companies goals, for the current week.
- **Personal Priority**: Something personal that you want to work on this week. Exapmples: Practice a habit, learn something new, get something done.

## From Idea to Project

Because we sometimes work remotely ([read more](/content/remote.md) on working remotely), it's important to document as much as we can. This is the process an idea usually goes through:

1. Post the idea on the 'Everything' board in Trello, under the 'Ideas for (name of project)' list.
2. Once the time is right, Move that idea to the 'Ideas We Decided to Implement' list on the same Trello board.
3. When we decide who will be responsible for bringing the idea to life and when it should be done, we will move the idea to our Basecamp list on Trello and add it to the corresponding project on Basecamp.
4. The idea goes live.
