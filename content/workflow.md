# Workflow: Priorities, What to Work on, From Idea to Project.

## How we set priorities:
On Mondays we have a discussion and decide what are the most important things we should get done (as a company) for the week.

Everyone then chooses a work priority and a personal priority.
- **Work Priority**: How you are going to contribute to accomplishing the companies goals, for the current week.
- **Personal Priority**: Something personal that you want to work on. A habit, learning something new, getting something done.

## From Idea to Project

Because we sometimes work remotely [read more on working remotely](/content/remote.md), it's important to document as much as we can. This is the process an idea usually goes through:

We post our idea on the Everything board in Trello, under the Ideas list. Usually, with a tag indicating which project it belongs to.

Once the time is right, someone will move that idea to the Ideas we decided to Implement list on the same Trello board.

When we decide who will be responsible for bringing the idea to life and when it should be done, we will move the idea to our Basecamp list on Trello and add it to the corresponding project on Basecamp.

Your idea goes live.
