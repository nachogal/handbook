# Learning: Culture Fridays, Dialogues, Independent Learning, etc.

Learning is reason #2 for why Junto exists. Learning is a priority for us.

Learning is important for us because we believe it is one of the activities that bring the most fullfilment into everyday life. If we learn about a particular topic for long enough, we'll experience [Mastery](http://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Keys-Success-Long-Term-Fulfillment/dp/0452267560). If we're learning something challenging enough, we'll experience [Flow](http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en).

These are some of the things we do:
- Take online classes together or as a group.
- Pay for online courses, memberships to things like Code School, Treehouse.
- Allow for learning during 'work time'.
- Dialogues: Get together (in person or via Hangout) to talk about books, articles, videos... anything really!
- Talks: Anyone can give a presentation about an interesting topic (not necessarily tech related). For example: personal finance, achieving happiness, etc.
- Guest Speakers: Invite someone external to one of our dialogues, or to give a 'talk'.
