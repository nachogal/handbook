# Our Culture of Learning

We set out on this journey to learn. We believe that learning is a life-long
habit. We want to be the examples for others of how fun and different education
can be!

We believe learning is among the activities that bring the most fulfillment into
everyday life. If we learn about a particular topic for long enough, we'll
experience [Mastery](http://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Keys-Success-Long-Term-Fulfillment/dp/0452267560).
If we're learning something challenging enough, we'll experience [Flow](http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en).

These are some of the things we do to foster our Culture of Learning:
- Pay for online courses. Memberships to programs like Code School, Treehouse,
One Month and Upcase.
- Take online classes together or as a group.
- Allow for learning during 'work time'.
- Weekly Dialogue: Get together (in person or via Hangout) to talk about books,
articles, videos (anything really!) that we've found interesting.
- Talks: Anyone can give a presentation about an interesting topic (not
necessarily tech related). For example: personal finance, achieving happiness, etc.
- Guest Speakers: Invite someone external to one of our dialogues, or to give a 'talk'.
