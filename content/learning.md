# Learning: Culture Fridays, Dialogues, Independent Learning, etc.

We set out on this journey to learn. We believe that learning is a life-long habit and we want to be the examples for others of how fun and different education can be!

Learning is important for us because we believe it is one of the activities that bring the most fullfilment into everyday life. If we learn about a particular topic for long enough, we'll experience [Mastery](http://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Keys-Success-Long-Term-Fulfillment/dp/0452267560). If we're learning something challenging enough, we'll experience [Flow](http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en).

These are some of the things we do:
- Pay for online courses. Memberships to things like Code School, Treehouse.
- Take online classes together or as a group.
- Allow for learning during 'work time'.
- Weekly Dialogue: Get together (in person or via Hangout) to talk about a book, article, video (anything really!) that we all encountered.
- Talks: Anyone can give a presentation about an interesting topic (not necessarily tech related). For example: personal finance, achieving happiness, etc.
- Guest Speakers: Invite someone external to one of our dialogues, or to give a 'talk'.
